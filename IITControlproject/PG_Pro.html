       <p><span style="font-size:20px; font-weight:bold;color:rgb(12, 12, 130);text-decoration: underline;" >Ph.D. Programme:-</span>  This program is a research-oriented programme. Creative thinking and innovations are primary requirements for this programme, and hence, it is important for a Ph.D. student to build-up such skills over the years. To overcome any deficiency in the breadth of fundamental knowledge and/or building up proper foundation in a particular research area, our faculty members offer some special preliminary as well as advanced level courses in the control engineering area. Our Ph.D. students are doing research in the areas: networked systems and control, distributed control and optimization, learning based control, robotics, adaptive and predictive control, robust and optimal control, model-order reduction, biological systems and control.</p> 

     <p>  We admit students in our Ph.D. programme twice in a year: i) during summer (May-June) and ii) during winter (December). Please see our admission webpage for advertisements and other admission related details.</p>

      <p ><span style="font-size:20px; font-weight:bold;color:rgb(12, 12, 130);text-decoration: underline;"> M.S. (Research) Programme:-</span> This programme is also a research-oriented program. The nature of training in this program is similar to Ph.D. program. However, the quantum of research work required to get a degree in this program is lower than Ph.D.. Further, the duration of enrolment for a student in this programme is typically two to three years. We admit students in this programme also twice in a year: i) during summer (May-June) and ii) during winter (December). Please see our admission webpage for advertisements and other admission related details. </p> 

      <p><span style="font-size:20px; font-weight:bold;color:rgb(12, 12, 130);text-decoration: underline;" >M.Tech. (Two Year) Programme:-</span> We offer M.Tech. degree in Control & Automation (EEA). The duration of this program is two years. To get a degree in this program, the students need to earn 48 Credits through post-graduate level courses and project works. There are three types of courses: i) Core courses, ii) Program Electives and iii) Open Electives. Core courses are compulsory courses, and it is mandatory for all enrolled students in this program to attend. A  basket of program-aligned courses are available as Program Electives, and students need to select a couple of courses for registration from this basket. There is no restriction on choosing a post-graduate level course as an Open Elective. Students can register any post-graduate level courses offered in the institute under Open Elective category. A student has to do master-level technical project (MTP-I and MTP-II) over one year. MTP-I, which is of 6 Credits, is compulsory for all students, whereas MTP-II is optional. One can earn equivalent Credits for MTP-II through course works. Semester-wise course distributions are listed towards the end of this page.  In addition to the course-work, the students need to do compulsory TA duties, which is typically of eight-hours per week. </p>
        
      <p><span style="font-size:20px; font-weight:bold;color:rgb(12, 12, 130);text-decoration: underline;"> M.Tech. (HVA) Programme:-</span> In addition to the traditional two year M.Tech. programme, we also offer M.Tech. High Value Assistantship (HVA) Programme, which is of three years duration. Both of these programmes are same from the academic viewpoint, that is, a student enrolled in M.Tech. HVA programme needs to earn the same credit (48 Credits) as required for two years M.Tech. programme. The difference is that in M.Tech. HVA programme, students need to earn the required credit in three years instead of two years. Further, they will get higher assistantship in comparison to the students in two year M.Tech. programme. The students in this programme will be assigned to some of our existing control laboratories, and they need do TA/administrative duties around twenty-hours per week.</p> 
        
   <p>    We admit students in both of our M.Tech. programmes once in a year: during summer (May-June). Please see our admission webpage for advertisements and other admission related details.</p>
